Our example
An animated gif showing a Flutter app in use. It starts with the user on a login screen. They log in and are taken to the catalog screen, with a list of items. The click on several items, and as they do so, the items are marked as "added". The user clicks on a button and gets taken to the cart view. They see the items there. They go back to the catalog, and the items they bought still show "added". End of animation.

For illustration, consider the following simple app.

The app has two separate screens: a catalog, and a cart (represented by the MyCatalog, and MyCart widgets, respectively). It could be a shopping app, but you can imagine the same structure in a simple social networking app (replace catalog for “wall” and cart for “favorites”).

The catalog screen includes a custom app bar (MyAppBar) and a scrolling view of many list items (MyListItems).

Here’s the app visualized as a widget tree.

A widget tree with MyApp at the top, and  MyCatalog and MyCart below it. MyCart area leaf nodes, but MyCatalog have two children: MyAppBar and a list of MyListItems.

So we have at least 5 subclasses of Widget. Many of them need access to state that “belongs” elsewhere. For example, each MyListItem needs to be able to add itself to the cart. It might also want to see whether the currently displayed item is already in the cart.

This takes us to our first question: where should we put the current state of the cart?

Lifting state up
In Flutter, it makes sense to keep the state above the widgets that use it.

Why? In declarative frameworks like Flutter, if you want to change the UI, you have to rebuild it. There is no easy way to have MyCart.updateWith(somethingNew). In other words, it’s hard to imperatively change a widget from outside, by calling a method on it. And even if you could make this work, you would be fighting the framework instead of letting it help you.

content_copy
// BAD: DO NOT DO THIS
void myTapHandler() {
  var cartWidget = somehowGetMyCartWidget();
  cartWidget.updateWith(item);
}
Even if you get the above code to work, you would then have to deal with the following in the MyCart widget:

content_copy
// BAD: DO NOT DO THIS
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SomeWidget(
    // The initial state of the cart.
  );
}

void updateWith(Item item) {
  // Somehow you need to change the UI from here.
}
You would need to take into consideration the current state of the UI and apply the new data to it. It’s hard to avoid bugs this way.

In Flutter, you construct a new widget every time its contents change. Instead of MyCart.updateWith(somethingNew) (a method call) you use MyCart(contents) (a constructor). Because you can only construct new widgets in the build methods of their parents, if you want to change contents, it needs to live in MyCart’s parent or above.

content_copy
// GOOD
void myTapHandler(BuildContext context) {
  var cartModel = somehowGetMyCartModel(context);
  cartModel.add(item);
}
Now MyCart has only one code path for building any version of the UI.

content_copy
// GOOD
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  var cartModel = somehowGetMyCartModel(context);
  return SomeWidget(
    // Just construct the UI once, using the current state of the cart.
    // ···
  );
}
In our example, contents needs to live in MyApp. Whenever it changes, it rebuilds MyCart from above (more on that later). Because of this, MyCart doesn’t need to worry about lifecycle—it just declares what to show for any given contents. When that changes, the old MyCart widget disappears and is completely replaced by the new one.

Same widget tree as above, but now we show a small 'cart' badge next to MyApp, and there are two arrows here. One comes from one of the MyListItems to the 'cart', and another one goes from the 'cart' to the MyCart widget.

This is what we mean when we say that widgets are immutable. They don’t change—they get replaced.

Now that we know where to put the state of the cart, let’s see how to access it.

Accessing the state
When a user clicks on one of the items in the catalog, it’s added to the cart. But since the cart lives above MyListItem, how do we do that?

A simple option is to provide a callback that MyListItem can call when it is clicked. Dart’s functions are first class objects, so you can pass them around any way you want. So, inside MyCatalog you can define the following:

content_copy
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SomeWidget(
    // Construct the widget, passing it a reference to the method above.
    MyListItem(myTapCallback),
  );
}

void myTapCallback(Item item) {
  print('user tapped on $item');
}
This works okay, but for an app state that you need to modify from many different places, you’d have to pass around a lot of callbacks—which gets old pretty quickly.

Fortunately, Flutter has mechanisms for widgets to provide data and services to their descendants (in other words, not just their children, but any widgets below them). As you would expect from Flutter, where Everything is a Widget™, these mechanisms are just special kinds of widgets—InheritedWidget, InheritedNotifier, InheritedModel, and more. We won’t be covering those here, because they are a bit low-level for what we’re trying to do.

Instead, we are going to use a package that works with the low-level widgets but is simple to use. It’s called provider.

Before working with provider, don’t forget to add the dependency on it to your pubspec.yaml.

content_copy
name: my_name
description: Blah blah blah.

# ...

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  provider: ^5.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  # ...
Now you can import 'package:provider/provider.dart'; and start building.

With provider, you don’t need to worry about callbacks or InheritedWidgets. But you do need to understand 3 concepts:

ChangeNotifier
ChangeNotifierProvider
Consumer
ChangeNotifier
ChangeNotifier is a simple class included in the Flutter SDK which provides change notification to its listeners. In other words, if something is a ChangeNotifier, you can subscribe to its changes. (It is a form of Observable, for those familiar with the term.)

In provider, ChangeNotifier is one way to encapsulate your application state. For very simple apps, you get by with a single ChangeNotifier. In complex ones, you’ll have several models, and therefore several ChangeNotifiers. (You don’t need to use ChangeNotifier with provider at all, but it’s an easy class to work with.)

In our shopping app example, we want to manage the state of the cart in a ChangeNotifier. We create a new class that extends it, like so:

content_copy
class CartModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  /// Internal, private state of the cart.
  final List<Item> _items = [];

  /// An unmodifiable view of the items in the cart.
  UnmodifiableListView<Item> get items => UnmodifiableListView(_items);

  /// The current total price of all items (assuming all items cost $42).
  int get totalPrice => _items.length * 42;

  /// Adds [item] to cart. This and [removeAll] are the only ways to modify the
  /// cart from the outside.
  void add(Item item) {
    _items.add(item);
    // This call tells the widgets that are listening to this model to rebuild.
    notifyListeners();
  }

  /// Removes all items from the cart.
  void removeAll() {
    _items.clear();
    // This call tells the widgets that are listening to this model to rebuild.
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
The only code that is specific to ChangeNotifier is the call to notifyListeners(). Call this method any time the model changes in a way that might change your app’s UI. Everything else in CartModel is the model itself and its business logic.

ChangeNotifier is part of flutter:foundation and doesn’t depend on any higher-level classes in Flutter. It’s easily testable (you don’t even need to use widget testing for it). For example, here’s a simple unit test of CartModel:

content_copy
test('adding item increases total cost', () {
  final cart = CartModel();
  final startingPrice = cart.totalPrice;
  cart.addListener(() {
    expect(cart.totalPrice, greaterThan(startingPrice));
  });
  cart.add(Item('Dash'));
});
ChangeNotifierProvider
ChangeNotifierProvider is the widget that provides an instance of a ChangeNotifier to its descendants. It comes from the provider package.

We already know where to put ChangeNotifierProvider: above the widgets that need to access it. In the case of CartModel, that means somewhere above both MyCart and MyCatalog.

You don’t want to place ChangeNotifierProvider higher than necessary (because you don’t want to pollute the scope). But in our case, the only widget that is on top of both MyCart and MyCatalog is MyApp.

content_copy
void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CartModel(),
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
Note that we’re defining a builder that creates a new instance of CartModel. ChangeNotifierProvider is smart enough not to rebuild CartModel unless absolutely necessary. It also automatically calls dispose() on CartModel when the instance is no longer needed.

If you want to provide more than one class, you can use MultiProvider:

content_copy
void main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => CartModel()),
        Provider(create: (context) => SomeOtherClass()),
      ],
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
Consumer
Now that CartModel is provided to widgets in our app through the ChangeNotifierProvider declaration at the top, we can start using it.

This is done through the Consumer widget.

content_copy
return Consumer<CartModel>(
  builder: (context, cart, child) {
    return Text("Total price: ${cart.totalPrice}");
  },
);
We must specify the type of the model that we want to access. In this case, we want CartModel, so we write Consumer<CartModel>. If you don’t specify the generic (<CartModel>), the provider package won’t be able to help you. provider is based on types, and without the type, it doesn’t know what you want.

The only required argument of the Consumer widget is the builder. Builder is a function that is called whenever the ChangeNotifier changes. (In other words, when you call notifyListeners() in your model, all the builder methods of all the corresponding Consumer widgets are called.)

The builder is called with three arguments. The first one is context, which you also get in every build method.

The second argument of the builder function is the instance of the ChangeNotifier. It’s what we were asking for in the first place. You can use the data in the model to define what the UI should look like at any given point.

The third argument is child, which is there for optimization. If you have a large widget subtree under your Consumer that doesn’t change when the model changes, you can construct it once and get it through the builder.

content_copy
return Consumer<CartModel>(
  builder: (context, cart, child) => Stack(
    children: [
      // Use SomeExpensiveWidget here, without rebuilding every time.
      if (child != null) child,
      Text("Total price: ${cart.totalPrice}"),
    ],
  ),
  // Build the expensive widget here.
  child: const SomeExpensiveWidget(),
);
It is best practice to put your Consumer widgets as deep in the tree as possible. You don’t want to rebuild large portions of the UI just because some detail somewhere changed.

content_copy
// DON'T DO THIS
return Consumer<CartModel>(
  builder: (context, cart, child) {
    return HumongousWidget(
      // ...
      child: AnotherMonstrousWidget(
        // ...
        child: Text('Total price: ${cart.totalPrice}'),
      ),
    );
  },
);
Instead:

content_copy
// DO THIS
return HumongousWidget(
  // ...
  child: AnotherMonstrousWidget(
    // ...
    child: Consumer<CartModel>(
      builder: (context, cart, child) {
        return Text('Total price: ${cart.totalPrice}');
      },
    ),
  ),
);
Provider.of
Sometimes, you don’t really need the data in the model to change the UI but you still need to access it. For example, a ClearCart button wants to allow the user to remove everything from the cart. It doesn’t need to display the contents of the cart, it just needs to call the clear() method.

We could use Consumer<CartModel> for this, but that would be wasteful. We’d be asking the framework to rebuild a widget that doesn’t need to be rebuilt.

For this use case, we can use Provider.of, with the listen parameter set to false.

content_copy
Provider.of<CartModel>(context, listen: false).removeAll();
Using the above line in a build method won’t cause this widget to rebuild when notifyListeners is called.

Putting it all together
You can check out the example covered in this article. If you want something simpler, see what the simple Counter app looks like when built with provider.

By following along with these articles, you’ve greatly improved your ability to create state-based applications. Try building an application with provider yourself to master these skills.
