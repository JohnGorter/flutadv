# Lab Compute

---
### Calculating the fib
Time: 30 minutes

--
### Setup
Inside this folder is a starter file. This is the start of the excercise. 
Create a brand new flutter application and copy and paste the starter file contents in the
main.dart inside the newly generated project.

---
### Excercise 1. Create a fib
Make the implementation of a fibbonaci sequence. The 
fibbonaci sequence is explained here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

Place the code in the therefore reserved fib function
// step1. your code here

Now add a call to call fib(40) just as you would do normally. 
Place this call in the // Step 2. your code here... placeholder.

Dont forget to add setState here because we want the result to be shown.

Run the code and watch the UI stutter.. This is expected!

---
### Excersize 2. Compute a fib

Place the fibbonaci call inside a compute function in the code where it says:
// Step 3. your code here...

Rerun the example. If you did it correctly, the UI should be fluent and the calculation now is inside another isolate!
