### Setup
You do not have to create a new flutter project for this lab. Just copy the starter.dart and use this file as your workspace in your favorite IDE.

### Excercise 1. Understand the code and see whats wrong
In the starter.dart is an implementation of an isolate to simulate offloading work to another thread/process.
Examine and run the code so you understand what the code is doing. Does the code work correctly? Does it ever complete?
What is wrong here?

### Excercise 2. Fix the bug
Refactor and complete the code so it is working correctly. The solution file has an example of working code.
