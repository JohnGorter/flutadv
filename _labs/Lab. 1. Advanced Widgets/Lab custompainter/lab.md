### charts
Time: 45 minutes

--
### Setup
Create a brand new flutter application and use the main.dart in your IDE.

---
### Excercise 1: Make a chart widget
Make a widget that takes a range of values and plots them on a line or bar chart. 
Use the CustomPaint to paint your chart. Add a constructor parameter that drives the
type of chart, bar or pie. 


---
### Excercise 2: Animate your chart
Animate your lines and/or bars whenever a value has changed. 
You need to record the previous and the current value of each plotted value in the chart.
Then you have to use Tweens and Animations to interpolate the values between the
last and current values and draw the chart with each interpolated value.
